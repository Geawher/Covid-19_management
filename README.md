## Covid-19 
The 2019-2020 Coronavirus Pandemic is a pandemic of an emerging infectious disease called Covid-19 called Covid-19 and caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It emerged in
the city of Wuhan in central China in early December 2019. It then spread to countries around the world.
As of 27 March, approximately 549,000 cumulative cases have been confirmed worldwide, including about 25,000 deaths. Like many other countries, Tunisia is affected by this
global crisis. Special measures are currently being implemented by the government, including the government, including the general lockdown procedure. 

## App features 
In this context, we wish to develop an application for detailed monitoring of the evolution of this pandemic in our country with a general monitoring of its evolution at 
the global level.
The application should therefore have two components:
1) **Tunisia component:** The application must provide as much as possible, the important details of the evolution of the pandemic in Tunisia, such as for example: the total
number of cases affected by the disease, number of new cases each day, total number of deaths, number of deaths per day, total number of tests performed, number of tests 
performed per day, etc. 
2) **Other countries of the world section:** The application should just provide some general information on some countries of the world, such as the total number of cases, 
number of deaths, etc.

## Database design :
To carry out this work, a database (JAVA: DERBY) was created to organize and manipulate the information. The model below defines the structure of the database:
